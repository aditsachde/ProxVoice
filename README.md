## Releases

Releases are automatically handled through Github Actions, however, no component currently updates automatically.

## Architecture

ProxVoice is split in two parts â€“ the Minecraft mod and the desktop client.

### Mod

The mod simply takes player distances and publishes them on a ZeroMQ Pub/Sub socket, providing a light and nonblocking transport.

### Desktop Client

Currently, this is a rust binary that does not provide a GUI. Config is specified using `proxvoice.config.yml`
