/**
 * Provides high-level bindings for ØMQ.
 * <br>
 * This is the java equivalent of <a href="https://github.com/zeromq/czmq">CZMQ project</a>.
 * <br>
 * Classes of this package tend to achieve these goals:
 * <ul>
 * <li>To wrap the ØMQ core API in semantics that lead to shorter, more readable applications.</li>
 * <li>To provide a space for development of more sophisticated API semantics.</li>
 * </ul>
