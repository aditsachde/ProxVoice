/**
 * <p>Provides high-level utility bindings for ØMQ.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is the java equivalent of <a href="https://github.com/zeromq/czmq">CZMQ project</a>,
 * but packaged separately to avoid proliferation of classes under the same namespace.</p>
 *
 * <p>Classes of this package tend to achieve these goals:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>To wrap the ØMQ core API in semantics that lead to shorter, more readable applications.</li>
 * <li>To provide a space for development of more sophisticated API semantics.</li>
 * </ul>
